# Embedded Systems Lab â€“ by 0xChunks

Welcome to my personal embedded systems labâ€”a focused, practical environment for learning and applying embedded software, Linux kernel development, RF systems, digital hardware design, and hardware/software co-integration. This repository serves as a cornerstone for my professional development in embedded systems, aligned with both my graduate studies and internship goals.

## Graduate Focus â€“ MS in Computer Engineering @ NC State

This project aligns with my MS in Computer Engineering with a concentration in Tactical Networking and Embedded Systems. My studies include embedded architecture, Linux operating systems, wireless networks, RF system design, digital hardware, and ASIC/FPGA verification.

These projects help reinforce and apply concepts in:
- Embedded firmware and real-time control
- Linux kernel module development
- Mesh networking and wireless communication
- FPGA design and system integration
- Hardware/software co-design and performance optimization

## Internship Preparation

This lab is designed to build practical experience in:
- Linux-based system development and kernel module interaction
- Interfacing with GPIO, interrupts, and UART peripherals
- Schematic-level hardware debugging and digital signal interfacing
- Embedded communication protocols including UART and RF (ESP-NOW)
- Integrating microcontrollers, FPGAs, and wireless devices into cohesive systems
- Soldering, PCB prototyping, and interfacing electronics with computing platforms

By completing this lab, I aim to contribute meaningfully to real-world embedded and communication systems, while continuing to develop into a versatile and dependable embedded systems engineer.
