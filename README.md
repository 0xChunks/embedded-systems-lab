# Embedded Systems Lab â€“ by 0xChunks

Welcome to my personal embedded systems labâ€”a focused, practical environment for learning and applying embedded software, Linux kernel development, RF systems, digital hardware design, and hardware/software co-integration. This repository serves as a cornerstone for my professional development in embedded systems, aligned with both my graduate studies and internship goals.

## Graduate Focus â€“ MS in Computer Engineering @ NC State

This project aligns with my MS in Computer Engineering with a concentration in Tactical Networking and Embedded Systems. My studies include embedded architecture, Linux operating systems, wireless networks, RF system design, digital hardware, and ASIC/FPGA verification.

These projects help reinforce and apply concepts in:
- Embedded firmware and real-time control
- Linux kernel module development
- Mesh networking and wireless communication
- FPGA design and system integration
- Hardware/software co-design and performance optimization

## Internship Preparation

This lab is designed to build practical experience in:
- Linux-based system development and kernel module interaction
- Interfacing with GPIO, interrupts, and UART peripherals
- Schematic-level hardware debugging and digital signal interfacing
- Embedded communication protocols including UART and RF (ESP-NOW)
- Integrating microcontrollers, FPGAs, and wireless devices into cohesive systems
- Soldering, PCB prototyping, and interfacing electronics with computing platforms

## Usage Instructions

1. **Clone the repo**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/0xChunks/embedded-systems-lab.git
   cd embedded-systems-lab
   ```

2. **Navigate to a project folder and build**:
   ```bash
   cd 03_kernel_char_device
   make
   sudo insmod gpio_module.ko
   ```

3. **Interact with hardware**:
   ```bash
   echo 1 | sudo tee /dev/gpiodev
   echo 0 | sudo tee /dev/gpiodev
   cat /dev/gpiodev
   ```

4. **Sysfs GPIO examples**:
   ```bash
   cat /sys/class/gpio_driver/gpio_device/button_state
   echo 1 > /sys/class/gpio_driver/gpio_device/led
   ```

5. **UART Kernel Output (05_kernel_uart)**:
   - Writes data to `/dev/serial0` using `kernel_write()` from within the kernel module.
   - Confirm UART wiring to microcontroller or USB-to-serial bridge.
   - Use `screen` or `minicom` to verify transmission:
     ```bash
     screen /dev/serial0 115200
     ```

6. **Unload when done**:
   ```bash
   sudo rmmod <module_name>
   ```
